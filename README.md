# Medical Inventory Optimization

## Introduction
This project aims to tackle the rising bounce rate within a healthcare institution, which has been causing patient dissatisfaction. The primary aim is to decrease the bounce rate by a minimum of 30%, while also cutting down on inventory expenses and expecting a revenue boost of at least 20 lacs INR. Employing a Data Analytics Project Management Methodology, the project will work with a dataset comprising 14,218 rows and 14 columns, specifically targeting the Supply Chain Management sector.

Efficient management of medical inventory holds immense importance for healthcare facilities worldwide. Inaccurate forecasting of drug demand can lead to issues like stockouts, overstocking, and increased expenses, all of which directly impact patient care. By harnessing advanced machine learning models, the proposed system seeks to refine medical inventory management practices, aiming to enhance stock availability, reduce bounce rates, elevate customer satisfaction, and minimize wastage in inventory costs.

To address the challenge of bounce rates in a healthcare setting, it's vital to concentrate on website optimization and improving user experience. Factors such as mobile responsiveness, readability, and site speed play pivotal roles in engaging patients and mitigating bounce rates. Strategies such as enhancing readability, optimizing for mobile platforms, and ensuring clear calls to action can significantly enhance user experience and lower bounce rates on medical practice websites.

## Overall Design Strategy
To develop a comprehensive design strategy for medical inventory management, the project will focus on addressing the rising bounce rate within a healthcare institution, which has been impacting patient satisfaction negatively.

The primary objective is to reduce the bounce rate by a minimum of 30%, while concurrently optimizing inventory expenses and anticipating a revenue increase of at least 20 lacs INR. By implementing a Data Analytics Project Management Methodology, the project will analyze a dataset comprising 14,218 rows and 14 columns, with a specific emphasis on the Supply Chain Management sector.

## Data Overview
The medical dataset comprises 14,218 records and includes essential columns that capture various aspects of pharmaceutical transactions, patient behavior, and inventory management. Here is an overview of the dataset:

- **Typeofsales**: Indicates the type of drug sale (sold or returned).
- **Patient_ID**: Unique identifier for patients.
- **Specialisation**: Name of the specialization (e.g., Cardiology).
- **Dept**: Pharmacy department related to the formulation.
- **Dateofbill**: Date of purchase of medicine.
- **Quantity**: Quantity of the drug purchased.
- **ReturnQuantity**: Quantity of drug returned by patients.
- **Final_Cost**: Final cost of the drug (including quantity).
- **Final_Sales**: Final sales amount of the drug.
- **RtnMRP**: Maximum Retail Price (MRP) of returned drugs.
- **Formulation**: Type of formulation.
- **DrugName**: Generic name of the drug.
- **SubCat**: Subcategory (Type) of the category of drugs.
- **SubCat1**: Subcategory (condition) of the category of drugs.

### Missing Values
The dataset contains missing values in several columns:
- **Formulation**: 4.59% missing values.
- **DrugName**: 11.73% missing values.
- **SubCat**: 11.73% missing values.
- **SubCat1**: 11.9% missing values.

Addressing these missing values through imputation or removal is crucial to ensure data integrity and reliability for subsequent data analysis processes.
